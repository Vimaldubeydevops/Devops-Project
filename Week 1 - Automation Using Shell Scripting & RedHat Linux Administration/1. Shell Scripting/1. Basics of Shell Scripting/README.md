# Shell Scripting

Welcome to **Shell Scripting**, a key component of our automation journey. In this session, we will delve into the basics of shell scripting and explore practical scenarios for automating tasks on Unix-based systems.

## Overview

Shell scripting allows you to automate repetitive tasks, manage system configurations, and handle complex workflows efficiently. This session covers foundational concepts, practical examples, and real-time scenarios to enhance your scripting skills.

# Basics of Shell Scripting

## Objective

The goal of this section is to understand the core concepts of shell scripting and to write basic scripts. By the end of this section, you should be able to write simple shell scripts, understand their syntax, and use them for automation tasks.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Shell Scripting

- **What is Shell Scripting?**
  Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks in Unix-based operating systems by writing scripts in a shell language. These scripts can perform a series of commands and operations that would otherwise be done manually.

- **Common Shells (Bash, Zsh, etc.)**
  - **Bash (Bourne Again Shell):** The most common shell used in Linux and macOS.
  - **Zsh (Z Shell):** Known for its extended features and customization options.

### 2. Writing Your First Shell Script

- **Script Syntax and Structure**
  - **Shebang (#!/bin/bash):** Indicates the script should be executed using the Bash shell.
  - **Basic Commands and Echo Statements:** Simple commands and how to print output to the terminal.

- **Using Shebang (#!/bin/bash)**
  The shebang line at the top of a script file tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script.

- **Basic Commands and Echo Statements**
  Learn how to use commands like `echo` to display messages and run basic commands.

### 3. Shell Scripting Syntax

- **Variables and Data Types**
  - Define and use variables.
  - Understand different data types available in shell scripting.

- **Conditional Statements (if, else, elif)**
  - Write scripts that perform actions based on conditions using `if`, `else`, and `elif`.

- **Loops (for, while, until)**
  - Automate repetitive tasks using `for`, `while`, and `until` loops.

- **Functions and Arguments**
  - Define and use functions to modularize your scripts.
  - Pass arguments to functions to make your scripts more flexible.

## Example Script

Here is a simple example script that demonstrates the basics of shell scripting:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a simple shell script

# Define a variable
name="World"

# Print a message
echo "Hello, $name!"

# Conditional statement
if [ "$name" == "World" ]; then
    echo "The name is World"
else
    echo "The name is not World"
fi

# Loop example
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Number $i"
done

# Function example
greet() {
    local greeting=$1
    echo "Greeting: $greeting"
}

greet "Hello"

# Print the variable
echo "Welcome, $name!"

# Loop through numbers
for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
